Step 1                                                Melt butter and olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add cream, garlic, and white pepper; bring to just under a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until mixture is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.
Step 2                                                Stir Parmesan cheese into cream mixture and simmer until sauce is thickened and smooth, 8 to 10 minutes. Add mozzarella cheese to sauce; cook and stir until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
Step 3                                               Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta to serving plates. Spoon sauce over pasta.                                   
Cook's Note:                                           For an added touch, sprinkle some freshly chopped parsley over your personal plate.                               If you have a rotisserie chicken just waiting to be used, I suggest to use the whole chicken breast and cut into bite-size pieces and stir into your finished sauce. Both could really take your dish to the next level.
